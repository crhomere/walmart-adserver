## Introduction to Ad Servers
Ad servers play a crucial role in the world of online advertising. One well-known ad server is Google AdSense.

When a website owner incorporates the Google AdSense code into their website, it enables the display of advertisements in specific locations. The revenue generated from these ads is then distributed by Google based on the traffic generated on the website.

This MVP aims to provide an understanding of how ad servers operate, starting from the creation of an advertiser's advertising campaign to the delivery of ads on the publisher's website.
